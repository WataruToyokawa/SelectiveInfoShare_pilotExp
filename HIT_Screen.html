<h1>Participate in a brief study on decision-making!</h1>
<p>
    Using the link below you can take part in a brief study on decision-making. You will be asked to perform a series of decision-making tasks, and answer a brief survey about your opinions and demographics (optional). Upon completing this study, you will receive a code to enter in the box below to claim your payment. You must enter (copy & paste) this code exactly as it is shown to claim your reward. 
</p>
<div class="highlight-box">
    <h2>You can participate in this study ONLY ONCE:</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        This HIT is one of a series of our decision-making studies (named <span class="note">Lottery Choice Task (fun + bonus!)</span>).<br> If you have already participated in this series in the past, please do <span class="note">NOT</span> accept this HIT. 
    </p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="highlight-box">
    <h2>In this HIT:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You will participate together with other participants in an interactive decision-making task. Because the task may require that several participants take part at the same time, you may have to wait for up to 3&nbsp;minutes to begin the task. You will be paid for the amount of time you wait.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the decision-making task is complete, there will be a short survey regarding your strategies and demographic information. All responses and results of this study are anonymous and confidential.
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="highlight-box">
    <h2>Reward and Bonus payment:</h2>
    <p>
        The rewards of this study consist of a flat fee for completion, plus the bonus payment earned during the decision-making task, plus a bonus for time spent waiting for other participants. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After you complete both decision-making and questionnaire tasks and submit this HIT, you will be paid a flat fee of US-$0.50&nbsp;for your conscientious completion of this study, plus a bonus payment (of up to US-$3) for the points accumulated during the decision-making task. In addition, you will receive US-$0.14 per minute (US-$8.40 an hour) for your time spent in the waiting room. Due to the performance-dependent nature of the bonus, we cannot state the exact amount that you will receive. However, you can expect earning a total reward between <span class="note">US-$2.50 and US-$4.00</span> for completing this HIT. The task will take most people about 15 minutes to complete.

<div class="highlight-box">
    <h2>Please make sure that your Internet access is stable:</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        During this experiment, you will be connected to our game server. If you are disconnected at any time, you will not be able to complete the task. This will decrease your overall amount of reward because the decision-making task will automatically end at this point and you will be directed to the survey part of this study. 
    </p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="highlight-box">
    <h2>Use a laptop or desktop computer (NO mobile platforms!):</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        The task is only available for a laptop or desktop computer environment. If you try to enter the task using a smart phone or tablet device, you may be automatically redirected to the end of the task (without even starting the decision-making task) and your HIT will not be approved.

                You can participate in this study <span class="note">only once</span>.

            <li>
                Please <span class="note">do not restart/reload your browser</span> once this study has started. If you do so, your decision-making task will be terminated automatically and you will be directed to the survey part upon resuming the task. This implies that you will keep any rewards that you have accumulated so far, but are not able to gain any additional rewards. 
                Also, you will not be able to participate again in this study.
            </li>
            <li>
                Likewise, if you your internet access is disconnected during the decision-making task, you will not be able to complete this task. Thus, <span class="note">please make sure that your Internet connection is stable</span>.

<h1>Participant Consent Form</h1>
<div class="highlight-box">
    <h2>Your rights as a participant:</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        Participation in this study is voluntary. You have the right to not participate at all, or to leave the study at any time. Deciding not to participate or choosing to leave the study results in no penalty, but you are only eligible for receiving payments when successfully completing the study. 
    </p>
</div>
<div class="highlight-box">
    <h2>Respecting other participants:</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        Please remember that this study may require you to interact with other MTurk workers in real time. This means that if you decide to take a lot of time for each decision, others may have to wait for you. Hence, please take the time you need, but also be mindful of the other participants.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="highlight-box">
    <h2>Confidentiality and data privacy:</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        The data that you provide will be only connected to your MTurk worker ID and anonymised at the earliest point in time. That is, after completion and compensation, the ID will be deleted from the dataset used for scientific analyses. Your anonymised data will only be associated with the demographic information you provided in the end of the questionnaire. Access to your anonymised data might be given to other researchers, including researchers from outside the University of Konstanz. Once the study is published, the anonymised data might be made available on a public data repository. Your rights to access, change or move your information are limited, as we need to manage your information in specific ways for the research to be reliable and accurate. Once anonymised, we will not be able to delete your data.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        If you have any questions or concerns you can contact the lead researcher Dr Wataru Toyokawa (spdslab@gmail.com). Please also contact Wataru Toyokawa, in case you wish to leave a word about any aspect of the way in which you have been approached or treated during the course of this study.
